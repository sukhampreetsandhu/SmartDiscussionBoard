# SmartDiscussionBoard
This Java-based Discussion Board application is designed to manage and interact with two types of posts, polls and text post. It was built using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and features a graphical user interface (GUI) for an enhanced user experience. The project showcases core Java concepts such as inheritance, collections, and file handling.

Features:
Collections: Implemented with ArrayList for dynamic post storage and HashMap for optimized keyword-based searches.
Graphical User Interface: Enhanced usability with a GUI built using JavaFX for intuitive interaction.
Dynamic Functionality: Supports adding, editing, deleting, and searching posts with flexible input options.
